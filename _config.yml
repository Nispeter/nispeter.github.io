# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am a passionate game developer who believes video games are the greatest form of art. Through immersive storytelling, engaging mechanics, and deep emotional connections, I strive to craft experiences that leave a lasting impact on players. My goal is to convey meaning, spark imagination, and push the boundaries of interactive entertainment, making every project a step toward artistic excellence.
