I'm a systems and gameplay game developer, passionate and highly motivated, with a Bachelor's in Engineering (Software Engineering) and a Master's in Computer Science. As a hobbyist, indie, and solo developer, I believe that games are works of art capable of crafting unforgettable experiences.

I have a strong interest in good coding practices and optimization, always striving to develop efficient and scalable systems. My focus lies in designing experiences, mechanics, and immersive ambiences that engage players deeply. I am particularly drawn to environmental storytelling and creating games that encourage players to think and explore.

**Favorite Games:** Outer Wilds, Civilization VI, Divinity original sin 2, Dark Souls, Monster Hunter, and Warframe.
