## Internship Overview

This project summarizes my **pre-professional internship at Hibring**, an engineering-focused company dedicated to technology transfer and applied scientific solutions. During this period, I worked mainly on **software development**, applying academic knowledge to real-world industrial projects used in the mining and geotechnical sectors.

My work was centered on two main products: **TerraRec** and **NyoRec**, both focused on digital data acquisition and georeferenced mapping in field conditions.

## TerraRec

**TerraRec** is a software solution for geological field mapping, designed to replace traditional paper-based workflows with digital tools. It allows professionals to map geological structures directly in the field and export the data to CAD and GIS-compatible formats.

### Key Contributions

* Implementation of **authentication systems** with session persistence.
* Development of **navigation stacks** and user option menus.
* Creation of dynamic views with **auto-refreshing lists** and filters.
* Support for **DXF file uploads**, including validation and error handling.
* UI modals for confirmations and unsaved changes.
* Code **refactoring and modularization** to improve maintainability.
* Documentation of features and internal logic.

## NyoRec

**NyoRec** focuses on the digital capture of geotechnical cell mapping, enabling structured data collection with full traceability, georeferencing, and reporting capabilities for mining operations.

### Key Contributions

* Design and implementation of **standardized UI components** (buttons, dropdowns, text fields, cards).
* Creation of **custom color themes** aligned with design guidelines.
* Development of complete application views such as login, home, and data capture flows.
* Modular **top navigation bars** and tab-based navigation.
* Validation of implementations against **Figma design mockups**.
* Code documentation to support long-term maintenance.

## Technologies Used

* **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript
* **Frameworks:** React, React Native
* **Tools:** Expo, Node.js, AWS CodeCommit
* **Design & Management:** Figma, Notion, Clockify

## Outcome

This internship was a key step in my professional development, strengthening my skills in front-end and mobile development while exposing me to production-level software used in the mining industry. It reinforced best practices in modular design, documentation, and collaborative development, and highlighted the importance of adaptability and continuous learning in real-world engineering environments.
