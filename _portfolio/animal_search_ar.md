## Game Description  
As part of the **EMOCREA** project, **AnimalSearchAR** is  an **augmented reality emotional learning experience** designed for children, developed as part of the FONDECYT EXPLORACIÓN 13220040 project and featured in the CICAT exhibition.  
Through an AR mobile app, children **explore and capture symbolic animals** by scanning real-world objects. Each animal represents a distinct emotional function and is accompanied by animations, interactive dialogues, and educational content—promoting **emotional intelligence through immersive play**.

Symbolic animals include:  
- 🐬 **Delfín** – Empathy  
- 🦊 **Zorro** – Curiosity  
- 🐢 **Tortuga** – Emotional Regulation  
- 🐵 **Chimpancé** – Facial Expression  
- 🦅 **Cóndor** – Mindfulness
